WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1580] Phase alignment: Unsupported clocking topology used for ISERDESE2 rd/des/iserdes_i. This can result in corrupted data. The rd/des/iserdes_i/OCLK / rd/des/iserdes_i/CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship and the rd/des/iserdes_i/CLK pin should be driven similarly to the rd/des/iserdes_i/OCLK pin. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide for supported clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.
